## Day 3

ARCHANGEL AZRAEL


Archangel Azrael – Whom God Helps
He is described as the Angel of Death, but this is a good thing. He comforts families and friends whose loved one passed. For the passing, he helps them to the light. He offers a lot of compassion and wisdom, and is here to also remind us that we have much to live for even after death.
His energy is calm, comforting, patient and understanding. His words are softly spoken. You can call on him for medium sessions, or if you need help after you’ve lost a loved one. Usually, he will bring both the spirit and the living relative/friend to a medium that will be the bridge of closure.

Dear Archangel Azrael
   Please help me to connect with loved ones on the other side.
Please allow them to visit my dreams or to send me special signs so that they are okay.
Thank you for always being there!
